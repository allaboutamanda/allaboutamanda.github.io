        <h2>What is This Issue?</h2>
        <div><img src="images/hunger.jpg" alt="african american mother and child" width="300"></div>
        <p>Not every poor person is hungry, but almost all hungry people are poor. The world does not produce enough food to feed everyone.  Millions live with hunger and malnourishment because they simply cannot afford to buy enough food, cannot afford nutritious foods or cannot afford the farming supplies they need to grow enough good food of their own.</p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <p>I believe that I am skilled in coding. My typing isn’t the greatest but it’s definitely not the worst in the class. I can type around 45 words per minute. I also have pretty good grades in school. At the moment, I have a 3.8 grade point average. Working in groups is a specialty of mine and I enjoy it and I enjoy it because I like to be able to get feedback from others. This is a sure way to get honest feedback because it's their project too.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>I really like to play soccer. If there isn’t a ball somewhere near then my next go to is listening to music and lounging around. I also enjoy going on hikes and walks with my dogs.</p>
