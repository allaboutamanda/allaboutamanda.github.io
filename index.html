        <h2>My family</h2>
        <p>I have a really big family because my parents re-married. Other than myself, I have 10 family members. In my mom’s house there’s my older step brother Johnathan, me, my eight year old brother Isaiah, my five year old brother Nathan, and my three year old sister Samantha and then my mom and step dad. On my dad’s side it’s my other sister Tricia, me, my four year old brother Dario, and my dad and step mom. My mom is a project manager for a dental company. My dad is an engineer for the Warner Brothers building. Both my parents are Mexican, so my family is Mexican American. I really like having a big family beacause that means you get extra love. Sometimes I get tired of my siblings but in all honesty, everyone does at one point. A plus side to having to different houses is that I get two birthday celebrations and two Christmas celebrations. Another thing that I love about having a big family is the fact that I am never lonley.</p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <p>I believe that I am skilled in coding. My typing isn’t the greatest but it’s definitely not the worst in the class. I can type around 45 words per minute. I also have pretty good grades in school. At the moment, I have a 3.8 grade point average. Working in groups is a specialty of mine and I enjoy it and I enjoy it because I like to be able to get feedback from others. This is a sure way to get honest feedback because it's their project too.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>I really like to play soccer. If there isn’t a ball somewhere near then my next go to is listening to music and lounging around. I also enjoy going on hikes and walks with my dogs.</p>
