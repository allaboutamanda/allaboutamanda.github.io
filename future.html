        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>My number one choice for high school is Sato Academy of Mathematics and Science. It’s more of a new school. In fact, they don’t even have a graduated class yet. At first my mom was a little skeptical of my decision. However, we did our research and discovered it’s a good school. Especially because I want to go to Cal Poly and become and engineer. </p>

        <h2>College</h2>
            <p>As I previously stated, I really would like to go to Cal Poly. Another college I would be pleased to attend is UC Berkeley. They are both located in California and I would like to stay local. Another reason I am considering these colleges is because I want to further a career in math and science.</p>
